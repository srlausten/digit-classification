# Changelog - Digit Classification

## To-do

- Update `.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml` to actually successfully build. This would require a personal registry setup.
- Add a main script/loop that will download --> train --> evaluate.
- Make a seperate  `train.py`.

## v0.1.0 - May 2, 2024

- Initial working solution.
